# Portfolio-with-Flutter
A simple Application can look soo different with just a few features. Flutter has released a new feature where we can move around widgets and zoom in and out them. In this simple portfolio Application the background colour of the app changes randomly when we press any of the buttons. It also plays a note when we press the button.Each time we press the button the note progresses. I have also added the new feature of flutter, interactive viewer by which we can move around the widgets and zoon in and out.
